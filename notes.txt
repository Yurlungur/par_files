resolution controled by dx,dy,dt.
xmax = 1
ymax,zmax can be as small as 3 grid points.
If I change resolution, must change domain size in y and z proportionally.

Very nonlinnear, should not expect amplitude of 0.1 to survive very
long. If there's a problem, reduce more.

Test many resolutions look for 4th order convergence.
Plot h^4 * error. curves should overlap in 1 time crossing

Run for many crossing times: then phase error may accumulate.


Start with 20 grid points as resolution.

For large resolution, reduce amount of output. Output is very slow.
